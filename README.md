# Python2022 Repository

🐍 Welcome to my Python2022 repository! This repository serves as a collection of all the code, tasks, and mini projects I worked on while learning Python in 2022. It showcases my progress and development as a Python programmer throughout the year.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
📦 Python2022
 ┣ 📜 task1.py
 ┣ 📜 task2.py
 ┣ 📜 task1.py
